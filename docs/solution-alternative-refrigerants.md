## Overview

As global temperatures rise, the demand for air conditioning and refrigeration is increasing. However, the refrigerants used in these systems are major contributors to global warming. Currently, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are the most commonly used refrigerants, with a global warming potential (GWP) up to 3,000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2).

The use of refrigerants is expected to grow by 10-15% per year, making the transition to alternative, low-GWP refrigerants crucial for mitigating climate change.

## Environmental Impact

- HFCs are short-lived in the atmosphere but have a very high GWP.
- Refrigerants in landfills produce potent greenhouse gases.
- The production and disposal of refrigerants also contribute to environmental pollution.
