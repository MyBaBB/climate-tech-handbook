# Alternative Refrigerants

Refrigerants are a major contributor to greenhouse gases. This article outlines the changes companies are making to both move to greener alternatives to refrigerate our food, homes, and businesses. Honeywell International, Diakin Industries, and more are helping the world move to greener systems.

## Overview

As the earth warms, air conditioning is becoming more of a necessity to combat heat waves. But the refrigerants used in home, commercial, industrial, and transportation air conditioning systems are a major contributor to global warming. Refrigerants are also used in refrigerators and in units that transport food to keep it cold. They're even used as solvents and in fire protection. 

Currently, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are the most commonly used refrigerant. Though they last only 15 years or less in the atmosphere, they are a major cause of greenhouse gas. The most commonly used HFCs have a capacity 3,000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) to warm the atmosphere. As more people use air conditioning to battle the heat, the more HFCs will be used. The use of refrigerants is expected to grow by 10-15% per year.
