## How to Organize

### 1. Pick a Venue
1. Make a list of potential venues with suitable size, location, and amenities for your event. Consider saving and sharing this list for future reference.
2. Call the venues to inquire about making a reservation for your desired event date(s). If a venue requires a reservation fee, you may have luck requesting a waiver in support of the climate change community.
3. Choose a venue that is available for your desired date(s)!

### 2. Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

### 3. Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

### 4. Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags, and food.
2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

### 5. Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
